# AbgabeDataVisualization

The following files are part of my university course work for Data Visualization, 2nd semester 2023.
Included are:
- 5 visualisations for grading
    > barchart_distance_categories.py
    > boxplot_animated.py
    > linechart.py
    > usmap.py
    > workingtop10.py
- screenshots of the following visualisations:
    > barchart distance (3 screenshots: barchart distance trace 1, barchart distance trace 2 & barchart distance trace 3)
    > linechart (2 screenshots: linechart arrival tooltip & linechart departure tooltip)
    > top 10 (2 screenshots: top 10 tooltip left & top 10 tooltip right)
    > usmap (2 screenshots: usmap arrival plot & tooltip and usmap departure plot & tooltip)
- one video of boxplot_animated: boxplot animation.mov
- 3 datasets used besides the main one:
    > airlines.csv
    > airports.csv
    > States - Sheet1.csv
- notforgrading:
  the top 10 visualisation but with a button to decide between horizontal and vertical barchart BUT it isn't working
  since they are subplots and with the update on the button the left charts become the main ones and then there are 
  no subplots so the right ones are staying the same/ not appearing. And I don't know how to fix that.
